Ari Check
Blackjack test

Included is a .jar file for running the program as well as all the source code under the folder: Ari_Blackjack
I've also included the library I used to create the "stunning" GUI (swt): org.eclipse.swt

Project was created, compiled, tested, etc. using Eclipse. It is written in java.

How to play:
Run the AriCheck_BlackjackTest.jar file (has only been tested in Windows).
Window opens in a locked 800x600 resolution for high definition viewing.
Primary play area is the majority of the screen on the left side of the Window.
4 buttons on the bottom of the window serve as the input for gameplay: stay, hit, end and reset.
stay - ends your turn and begins the dealer's
hit - asks for an additional card. Will automatically bust you. Will NOT automatically make you win if you get 21.
end - ends the game regardless of where you are in the deck. Will tally and display the score.
reset - resets the game to start a new one. Requires the game to have ended in some way first.

On the right hand side there is a testing field with tests built in so you can either cheat or simply play with parts of the game. Four buttons here as well: shuffle, show deck, dealer total and player total.
shuffle - will end the game and shuffle the deck, displaying the new order of the cards on the right hand side in the text box.
show deck - will NOT end the game or shuffle it but rather shows the current state of the deck as well as where the current top of the deck is located.
dealer total - displays the current total value of the dealer's cards
player total - displays the current total value of the player's cards
